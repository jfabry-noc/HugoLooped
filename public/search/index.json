(note: i\u0026rsquo;m 100% not saying that i\u0026rsquo;m \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;; this was just my personal impression. if a classical guru out there happens to stumble across this post and loves the classical app over apple music, i\u0026rsquo;d be extremely curious to hear the reasoning!)\n","title":"Apple Music Classical"},{"date":"2023-04-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://looped.network/posts/site-design-update/","summary":"Note: This post is no longer accurate since the site has moved from Write.as.

is actually what is intended to be my dining room. however, i have a bar-top in my apartment with several stools at it, and since i live by myself i literally always eat my meals there; i actually got rid of the table and chairs i used at my last apartment when i moved since i knew i wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use them here.\nmy main idea was that i wanted to have 2 distinct setups: one for work and one for personal. it wasn\u0026rsquo;t so much for a mental break between the two but just to keep me from having to constantly be swapping peripherals between my laptops. my initial thought was to get a very long desk and have two distinct spaces right next to one another. after looking at a few options in person, though, i decided i liked the idea of two medium-length desks that i could put together in an l shape. that\u0026rsquo;s what i eventually ended up deciding to go with:\non the way back from buying the desks, we also stopped at a computer hardware store where i bought the second (larger) monitor to include with the new setup. this allows me to just operate off of the 2 external displays while i\u0026rsquo;m working, leaving the laptop itself closed. to the right is my current personal setup, which is just a laptop on a stand that brings it close enough for me to use given how terrible my vision is. i may eventually get a monitor for this setup as well, but i\u0026rsquo;m also debating getting either a new laptop or swapping to a mini-pc of some sort. until i make a firm decision on that, i\u0026rsquo;m happy enough with a laptop stand and 2 wireless peripherals i never need to worry about plugging and unplugging.\ni also ended up changing the rest of the space a bit, taking a large chair that i had for years and tucking it into a corner after shifting around a small set of bookshelves and a replacement for the coffee table in the first photo that i swapped with a different one in my apartment to keep the all-black-everything theme going:\nthis makes for a cozy little \u0026ldquo;lounge\u0026rdquo; part of my office. i usually sit there in the morning with a cup of coffee and read before i start work for the day. i\u0026rsquo;ll also hop into the chair to doomscroll through my phone when i\u0026rsquo;m taking a break or if i\u0026rsquo;m on a call that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require me to be in front of my computer. in fact, if i\u0026rsquo;m not actively working on my computer as a part of the call, i actually like stepping away from it to ensure that i focus on the call instead of getting distracted by some code i was in the middle of working on, a slack message, etc.\nwhile i feel a little ridiculous for working under such cramped conditions for so long, it really was something i just got acclimated to and didn\u0026rsquo;t feel particularly inconvenienced by at the time. now that i\u0026rsquo;ve upgraded, though, this is easily my favorite part of the apartment, and i find myself spending a lot of time here even when i\u0026rsquo;m not working. it\u0026rsquo;s amazing how much easier it is to focus on things like my personal side projects or maintaining this blog when i have a comfortable space to do so.\n","title":"Home Office Upgrade"},{"date":"2023-03-25","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://looped.network/posts/functional-scrollbars/","summary":"Lately I\u0026rsquo;ve been lamenting the death of the functional scrollbar.

and still had my coax service, my plan was to simply turn off the router connected to my coax modem and make the t-mobile ssid and psk the same as what i was currently using so that everything i had would just automatically reconnect to the new gateway. that was a good idea, but for some absurd reason t-mobile decided to disallow spaces in the ssid. i can\u0026rsquo;t fathom why this would be the case since having spaces in an ssid is complete valid, but there was no means by which to work around it\u0026hellip; meaning i had to reconnect all of my devices to a different wireless network to effectively test it. while that\u0026rsquo;s not a huge deal for computers, tablets, and phones, it\u0026rsquo;s truly painful for iot devices and streaming sticks.\nperformance performance was quite good, though admittedly not as good as i was expecting. as mentioned previously, my phone (an iphone 13) regularly pulls down 500 mbps or more. my 5g home gateway would usually get around 200 mbps. i could quite literally set my phone right next to the gateway, and while on wifi i would get 200 mbps down while swapping my phone to 5g would result in 500 mbps down.\nhere\u0026rsquo;s a speed test i had taken from my phone while connected to wifi:\nand this is an example of relatively slow 5g speeds on my phone itself\u0026hellip; which are still significantly better than the home service:\ni\u0026rsquo;m guessing there must be some kind of traffic shaping that\u0026rsquo;s prioritizing mobile throughput over home throughput, but that\u0026rsquo;s just wild speculation on my part. living by myself, 200 mbps is more than enough, though, and was comparable to my coax service that i was paying more for.\ni had been more concerned about latency and jitter, but those proved to be non-issues. conference calls on the web, including watching screenshares and sharing my own screen, worked without any issues. rdp and ssh sessions across the internet were similarly as performant as i would expect. streaming video, music, and even playing online games even had no issues.\nproblems the problem i eventually ran into, though, was that i was struggling to maintain a consistent connection to a vpn i use to access a development environment for work. how frequently i need to be connected to this vpn varies based upon what i\u0026rsquo;m working on at any given moment, but when i need to access the vpn, i need to access the vpn. the behavior i saw is that it would work for some variable amount of time after connecting; sometimes it would be an hour, sometimes it would be an entire day. but occasionally it would suddenly begin to drop 50% or more of the packets, and response times would be measured in tens of seconds rather than milliseconds. this would persist for anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, at which point it would usually clear up. from there it would again continue to work for a variable amount of time before causing havoc again.\nwhen the issue transpired, only the vpn was impacted. connectivity to the public web was fine, as was throughput, latency, and jitter. troubleshooting this was fairly easy since when the issue occurred, just trying to ping the public-facing gateway for the vpn (not even being connected to it) would show dropped packets and latency. i saw the same behavior when i connected my laptop to my phone\u0026rsquo;s wifi hotspot, which was naturally also using t-mobile\u0026rsquo;s network. then i connected to a vps i have via ssh and attempted to ping the same vpn gateway. this would show no packet loss and 40 ms response times. likewise, slack wasn\u0026rsquo;t blowing up with people reporting vpn issues, so clearly i was the only one experiencing a problem.\nsupport after this, i called up t-mobile to ask them what was going on. the short of it, which i\u0026rsquo;m honestly a bit impressed that they were very upfront about, was that corporate vpns often don\u0026rsquo;t work reliably on their network. the customer service representative i spoke to basically said there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything they could do from their end, and that if this was going to be a problem it would be best for me to use a different service.\non one hand, i really appreciate the candor. on the other hand, if this is such a known issue then i think maybe some sort of disclaimer when signing up for the service would be warranted, such as noting that corporate vpns may not be usable. if nothing else, i would\u0026rsquo;ve tested this facet much more rigorously out of the gate. even the csr said that when she works from home for t-mobile she can\u0026rsquo;t use their home internet service due to vpn-related issues. if nothing else, she offered to make notes on my account so that if i needed to cancel after procuring another service they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t try to hassle me into staying subscribed to a service that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work for me.\naftermath almost as soon as that call was over i reached out to the local provider which had recently lit up fiber services in my area and got an appointment for later that week. there was already a drop in my apartment, but i would still need a strand run from that to wherever i would actually egress. pricing was fairly aggressive, especially because\u0026ndash;as a new service in the area\u0026ndash;they were offering some special deals that i was able to take advantage of. once the service was connected and i verified that everything worked, i called t-mobile back.\ni have to give the original csr credit, as when i called back and explained why i needed to cancel my service, the new csr didn\u0026rsquo;t try to talk me into staying. she prompted processed the cancellation and provided me with a shipping label to send the 5g gateway back.\nconclusion on the whole, i\u0026rsquo;m honestly a little bit bummed that t-mobile\u0026rsquo;s service didn\u0026rsquo;t work out for me as i really liked the idea of it. the price was good and\u0026ndash;vpn connectivity aside\u0026ndash;the performance was great. humorously enough, just a few weeks after i cancelled my service, i found out that my work is decommissioning the vpn i had problems with as we move our development lab to a new environment. that\u0026rsquo;s not to say t-mobile\u0026rsquo;s service wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the same problems with the vpn for the new environment, but it\u0026rsquo;s just amusing timing to me.\nin the future, i\u0026rsquo;d absolutely consider t-mobile\u0026rsquo;s home service again if i find myself shopping around. i\u0026rsquo;d probably just try to spend some time working from my phone\u0026rsquo;s hotspot\u0026ndash;at least a few days\u0026ndash;to see if there are any obvious issues prior to opting in, though.\n","title":"Trying T-Mobile Home Internet"},{"date":"2023-03-18","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://looped.network/posts/proton-simplelogin/","summary":"While going down a rabbit hole on Mastodon the other day, I stumbled across a post from SimpleLogin saying that they were now a part of the Proton family.

(humorously, i never expensed this domain \u0026ndash; even after it became \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; because it renewed on the same date as laifu.moe, and i didn\u0026rsquo;t want to submit the receipt showing both domains. 😅) that leaves me with:\n this domain. the aforementioned laifu.moe, the domain i\u0026rsquo;ve actually owned the longest, and the only domain i\u0026rsquo;ve ever purchased as a \u0026ldquo;joke\u0026rdquo; and actually done something with. a random domain i bought prior to deciding that i\u0026rsquo;d rather just use looped.network as my primary domain. i\u0026rsquo;m letting this one expire, though it has until next summer.  it\u0026rsquo;s typically been easy for me to justify the expense of domains because i tend to use (relatively) inexpensive tlds. i believe the most expensive domain i\u0026rsquo;ve ever purchased as a .io that was around $40 usd for a year. while tlds which are $10 to $15 a year are a bit more palatable, they still add up when i\u0026rsquo;ve got a large number of them\u0026hellip; and that cost is doing absolutely nothing if i do nothing with the domain. today i\u0026rsquo;d only consider purchasing a domain if i have an immediate use for it; i no longer buy any just because it\u0026rsquo;s a fun name that i want to hold on to. i\u0026rsquo;ve actually had a handful of scenarios where i thought of decent domain names and discovered they were available, but so far i\u0026rsquo;ve been walking the straight and narrow without buying them.\nwhile it\u0026rsquo;s a little silly to keep a domain for a single web page, i don\u0026rsquo;t see myself ditching laifu.moe any time soon since my inner weeb likes it too much. looped.network hosts several websites (like this one) and a few servers/services that i run, so it\u0026rsquo;s also pretty locked in. at this point i think i\u0026rsquo;d have to have something pretty outstanding that i wouldn\u0026rsquo;t just host it on another subdomain of looped.network.\n","title":"Decreasing Domains"},{"date":"2022-09-17","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://looped.network/posts/manjaro-invalid-corrupt-package/","summary":"As the title alludes to, this morning I tried updating my Pinebook Pro running Manjaro Linux through my normal method:\nsudo pacman -Syu Today, this resulted in an error message about the libibus package:\n warning: could not fully load metadata for package libibus-1.5.26-2 error: failed to prepare transaction (invalid or corrupted package)\n Fun.

then i just updated my init.vim with the plugins i wanted to install:\ncall plug#begin(\u0026#39;~/.config/plugged\u0026#39;) plug \u0026#39;https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim.git\u0026#39; plug \u0026#39;https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline.git\u0026#39;

i could pick whatever arbitrary location i wanted. plugins can be installed with any valid git link. you can see above that there\u0026rsquo;s a mix of full urls and a shorthand method. i started off by just copying the links for plugins i already used with vim (all of the full github links) and then adding the others as i looked up how to do some additional configuration. more on those later.\nwith init.vim updated, i just needed to close and re-open neovim for everything to apply, followed by running:\n:pluginstall this opens a new pane and shows the progress as the indicated plugins are all installed. what\u0026rsquo;s really cool about this is that i can also use :plugupdate to update my plugins, rather than going to my plugin folder and using git commands to check for them.\nnote on configuration i ultimately ended up doing all of my configuration in vimscript. i would actually prefer to use lua, but most of the examples i found were using vimscript. i also have a fairly lengthy function in my original vim configuration for adding numbers to my tabs that i didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have to rewrite, especially since i wholesale copied it from somewhere online. depending on what you want to do, however, you may end up with a mix of both, especially if you find some examples in vimscript and some in lua. this is entirely possible. just note there can be only one init file, either init.vim or init.lua. if you create both, which is what i initially did, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a warning each time you open neovim and only one of them will be loaded.\nto use init.vim as a base and then also import some lua configuration(s), i created a folder for lua at:\n~/.config/nvim/lua\nin there, i created a file called basic.lua where i had some configuration. then, back in init.vim, i just added the following line to tell it to check this file as well:\nlua require(\u0026#39;basic\u0026#39;) error checking note: i ended up not using the steps below, so if you want to follow along with exactly what i ended up using, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to actually do any of the steps in this section.\nthis is where some options come in to play. astute readers may have noticed the second to last plugin in my vim-plug config was for:\nplug \u0026#39;neovim/nvim-lspconfig\u0026#39; this is for the lsp, or language server protocol. this allows neovim to talk to various language servers and implement whatever functionality they offer. however, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually come with any language servers included, so i needed to get those and configure them as needed. for example, i could install pyright from some other source, like npm:\nnpm i -g pyright and then i needed additional configuration to tell neovim about this lsp. the samples were in lua, which is why i initially needed to use lua configuration alongside vimscript:\nrequire\u0026#39;lspconfig\u0026#39;.pyright.setup{} this actually worked for me with respect to error checking. opening up a python file would give me warnings and errors on the fly. however, i didn\u0026rsquo;t get any code completion. i started looking at options for this, but frankly a lot of them seemed pretty involved to set up, and i wanted something relatively simple rather than having to take significant amounts of time configuring my editor any time i use a new machine or want to try out a different language.\ncode completion ultimately, i stumbled onto onto conquer of completion, or coc. i don\u0026rsquo;t know why it took me so long to find as it seems to be insanely popular, but better later than never. one of coc\u0026rsquo;s goals is to be as easy to use as doing the same thing in vs code, and i honestly think they\u0026rsquo;ve nailed it. i first installed it via vim-plug in init.vim:\nplug \u0026#39;neoclide/coc.nvim\u0026#39;, {\u0026#39;branch\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;release\u0026#39;} after restarting neovim and running :pluginstall, i could now install language servers straight from neovim by running :cocinstall commands:\n:cocinstall coc-json coc-css coc-html coc-htmldjango coc-pyright after this, i fired up a python file and saw that i had both error checking and code completion. there was just one final step.\nkey mapping given the wide array of key mapping options and customizations that people do, coc doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to make any assumptions about what key mappings are available and which may already be in use. as a result, there are no custom mappings by default. instead, they need to be added to your neovim configuration just like any other mapping changes. however, the project shares a terrific example configuration with some recommended mappings in their documentation. i legitimately just copied the sample into my existing init.vim file. this adds some extremely useful mappings like:\n gd to take me to the declaration for what i\u0026rsquo;m hovering. k to show the documentation for what i\u0026rsquo;m hovering (based on the docstring for python, for example.) ]g to go to the next error/warning and [g to go to the previous one. tab and shift + tab to move through the options in the code completion floating window. enter to select the first item in the code completion floating window. a function to remap ctrl + f and ctrl + b, which are normally page down and page up, to scroll up and down in floating windows but only if one is present.  and tons of other stuff great stuff. i initially spent about 30 minutes just playing around with some throwaway code to test all of the different options and key mappings. it honestly feels super natural and now gives me the same benefits of vs code while allowing me to use a much leaner and more productive editor in neovim.\n","title":"Real Time Error Checking and Code Completion With Neovim"},{"date":"2022-08-14","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://looped.network/posts/gss-ntlmssp-alpine/","summary":"I recently found myself working on a project which required the GSS-NTLMSSP library.
