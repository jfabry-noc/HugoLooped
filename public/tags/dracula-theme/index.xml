      <description>Note: This post is no longer accurate since the site has moved from Write.as. However, here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of what it looked like at the time; I was quite happy with it!
The entire time this particular site has been in existence at Write.as, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the Carbontwelve theme for it. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly slick theme with some nice effects; I&amp;rsquo;ve been fairly happy with it. My only real issue is that it&amp;rsquo;s a light theme, which I (more or less) never use for anything given the option.</description>
