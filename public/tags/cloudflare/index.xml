      <description>Shortly after making my post regarding my return to Hugo yesterday, I noticed a potential issue with my new site. While testing it from the local Hugo development server everything looked great. After linking Cloudflare Pages with the repo and deploying it, though, things started to misbehave. Namely, the CSS and JavaScript weren&amp;rsquo;t being loaded, giving me an extremely ugly site with the .svg logo being the full width of the screen, a default white background, and black text with blue links.</description>

      <description>After a little over a year with Write.as, this site is once again being built with Hugo, my favorite static site generator. I&amp;rsquo;m currently hosting it through Cloudflare Pages. I don&amp;rsquo;t know that Cloudflare is any better or worse than other static hosts out there, but since I already use them for a handful of things (including hosting another site), I figure it&amp;rsquo;s easier for me to just keep everything in one place.</description>
