      <description>It just dawned on me that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally made good progress in decreasing the number of domains that I own. I&amp;rsquo;ve historically purchased domains on a whim; when I&amp;rsquo;m bored or sitting on a bar stool somewhere, I&amp;rsquo;ll grab my phone and check if random domains that pop into my head are available. While the overwhelming majority of them would be taken, I&amp;rsquo;d occasionally strike upon something that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been snatched up.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;It just dawned on me that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally made good progress in decreasing the number of domains that I own. I&amp;rsquo;ve historically purchased domains on a whim; when I&amp;rsquo;m bored or sitting on a bar stool somewhere, I&amp;rsquo;ll grab my phone and check if random domains that pop into my head are available. While the overwhelming majority of them would be taken, I&amp;rsquo;d occasionally strike upon something that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been snatched up. I&amp;rsquo;d typically &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; buy them&amp;hellip; and then do nothing with them the vast majority of the time. They were basically like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icann.org/&#34;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; PokÃ©mon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://looped.network/2022/icann_domains.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ash from Pokemon collecting domain names from ICANN&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a year ago, I decided that I would start to let some of my domains lapse through attrition. I turned off automatic renewal and figured that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t come up with a use for a particular domain by the time I started getting alerts about the fact that it was expiring, then I didn&amp;rsquo;t really need it in the first place. At the time I owned 9 domains. To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve let 5 of them expire. 1 was something I used for a skunk works project at my job that ended up becoming fairly critical to their workflow, so I transferred that domain to the company when I left that job. (Humorously, I never expensed this domain &amp;ndash; even after it became &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; because it renewed on the same date as &lt;a href=&#34;https://laifu.moe&#34;&gt;laifu.moe&lt;/a&gt;, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to submit the receipt showing both domains. ðŸ˜…) That leaves me with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://looped.network&#34;&gt;This domain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aforementioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://laifu.moe&#34;&gt;laifu.moe&lt;/a&gt;, the domain I&amp;rsquo;ve actually owned the longest, and the only domain I&amp;rsquo;ve ever purchased as a &amp;ldquo;joke&amp;rdquo; and actually done &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random domain I bought prior to deciding that I&amp;rsquo;d rather just use &lt;a href=&#34;https://looped.network&#34;&gt;looped.network&lt;/a&gt; as my primary domain. I&amp;rsquo;m letting this one expire, though it has until next summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s typically been easy for me to justify the expense of domains because I tend to use (relatively) inexpensive TLDs. I believe the most expensive domain I&amp;rsquo;ve ever purchased as a &lt;code&gt;.io&lt;/code&gt; that was around $40 USD for a year. While TLDs which are $10 to $15 a year are a bit more palatable, they still add up when I&amp;rsquo;ve got a large number of them&amp;hellip; and that cost is doing absolutely nothing if I do nothing with the domain. Today I&amp;rsquo;d only consider purchasing a domain if I have an immediate use for it; I no longer buy any just because it&amp;rsquo;s a fun name that I want to hold on to. I&amp;rsquo;ve actually had a handful of scenarios where I thought of decent domain names and discovered they were available, but so far I&amp;rsquo;ve been walking the straight and narrow without buying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s a little silly to keep a domain for a single web page, I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself ditching &lt;a href=&#34;https://laifu.moe&#34;&gt;laifu.moe&lt;/a&gt; any time soon since my inner weeb likes it too much. &lt;a href=&#34;https://looped.network&#34;&gt;looped.network&lt;/a&gt; hosts several websites (like this one) and a few servers/services that I run, so it&amp;rsquo;s also pretty locked in. At this point I think I&amp;rsquo;d have to have something pretty outstanding that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just host it on another subdomain of &lt;a href=&#34;https://looped.network&#34;&gt;looped.network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
