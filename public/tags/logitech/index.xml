      <description>Background I recently ran into some issues with the keyboard I had been using for the past few years and decided it was time to opt for something new. The keyboard I was moving away from was the Keychron K2 V2. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a love-hate relationship with mechanical keyboards, flipping between feeling like they give me a really good typing experience and thinking they sacrifice too much in terms of ergonomics to be worth the price of admission.</description>
