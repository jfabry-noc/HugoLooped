      <title>Pylint Import Error</title>

      <description>I recently found myself quickly checking in on a Python project outside of my normal Neovim workflow. I was basically just trying to quickly re-familiarize myself with some code that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t looked at or thought about in a few months before deploying it for a customer. If I&amp;rsquo;m feeling particularly lazy when doing something like this, I&amp;rsquo;ll often open something up in Sublime rather than Neovim just because it allows me to quickly scroll through a project and hop between files.</description>
