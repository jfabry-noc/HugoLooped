            After a little over a year with Write.as, this site is once again being built with Hugo, my favorite static site generator. I&rsquo;m currently hosting it through Cloudflare Pages. I don&rsquo;t know that Cloudflare is any better or worse than other static hosts out there, but since I already use them for a handful of things (including hosting another site), I figure it&rsquo;s easier for me to just keep everything in one place.

            Last week Apple released Apple Music Classical, a variant of their Apple Music streaming service (and which operates off of the same subscription) but that only contains classical music. While I&rsquo;m no expert by any stretch, I&rsquo;m actually a bit of a classical music fan. It&rsquo;s something I turn to frequently when I want music without any lyrics (e.g. when I&rsquo;m reading or trying to focus on something for work.) My car&rsquo;s stereo is even always tuned to the local classical music station, though I typically only listen to it for a few moments until Bluetooth connects.

            Note: This post is no longer accurate since the site has moved from Write.as. However, here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what it looked like at the time; I was quite happy with it!
The entire time this particular site has been in existence at Write.as, I&rsquo;ve used the Carbontwelve theme for it. It&rsquo;s a fairly slick theme with some nice effects; I&rsquo;ve been fairly happy with it. My only real issue is that it&rsquo;s a light theme, which I (more or less) never use for anything given the option.

            In a move that was highly overdue, I finally redid my home office several weeks ago. It&rsquo;s actually embarrassing to share, but this is what it had looked like prior to the overhaul&hellip; not that I would even call this an office:
Background Saying that the desk is small is an understatement. I&rsquo;ve actually owned this desk for years, and the story behind it is that I needed a small desk at my previous apartment.

            Lately I&rsquo;ve been lamenting the death of the functional scrollbar. Remember back in the day when scrollbars looked like this?
The scrollbars were prominent because they were meant to be used. You were expected to grab one with your mouse and move it up and down. Today, scrollbars have a much different appearance and expectation of functionality. This is what they look like in Firefox on Gnome 43 running under Fedora 37:
