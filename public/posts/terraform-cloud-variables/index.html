        <p>This post easily falls into the “so ridiculous that it shouldn’t be a post” category. However, considering how long I ended up stuck on it earlier today, I figure it’s worth making if it stands a chance of helping even one other person avoid the same fate as me. 😅</p>
<p>I’ve started doing a little bit of work with the Terraform Cloud API. Specifically, I was looking at being able to update a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspace-variables">workspace variable</a> through code. In this case, I was trying to change a variable I called <code>replica_count</code> which, if the name wasn’t enough of a giveaway, I was using to track how many replicas should be used in a Kubernetes container spec.</p>
<p>I found that I was able to easily get back all of my workspace variables via a <code>GET</code> to:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/workspaces/{workspace_id}/vars/
</code></pre><p>However, trying to make a <code>PATCH</code> to&hellip;</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/workspaces/{workspace_id}/vars/{variable_id}
</code></pre><p>&hellip; with a body in JSON to specify the change resulted in a 500 internal server error response.</p>
<p>The JSON in the body wasn’t very complex. I only needed to modify the value. As the documentation specifies, and the <code>type</code> must be set to “vars” and the <code>id</code> must be set to the ID of the variable to change. This is a bit odd to me since I <em>also</em> have to give the ID in the URL, but it’s not a big deal. The <code>attributes</code> property then can optionally contain whatever property or properties need to be updated. In my case, the JSON just looked like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
    “data”: {
        “id”: var_id,
        “type”: “vars”,
        “attributes”: {
            “value”: 2
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>There isn’t a lot to go wrong here&hellip; but I managed to do it! I finally figured out what was wrong when I changed my <code>PATCH</code> to a <code>GET</code> just to validate that my JSON had to be the culprit. The <code>GET</code> responds with JSON which is <em>very</em> similar to what I needed to send, and that’s what tipped me off to the fact that the value of the variable is <strong>always</strong> a string, even if I’m thinking of it as a number in my head. So my <code>value</code> line needed to be:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>“value”: “2”
</code></pre><p>After seeing that in the response to my <code>GET</code>, I updated my JSON, re-<code>PATCH</code>ed, and saw that everything was successful.</p>
