    <div><p>I recently found myself quickly checking in on a Python project outside of my normal <a href="https://looped.network/posts/neovim-lsp/">Neovim</a> workflow. I was basically just trying to quickly re-familiarize myself with some code that I hadn&rsquo;t looked at or thought about in a few months before deploying it for a customer. If I&rsquo;m feeling particularly lazy when doing something like this, I&rsquo;ll often open something up in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> rather than Neovim just because it allows me to quickly scroll through a project and hop between files. I frequently do the same thing when I&rsquo;m walking through some code on a screen share just because a GUI editor lends itself to that better, in my experience. While I don&rsquo;t use Sublime as my main editor, I do have it fairly configured, including with <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-pyright">pyright</a>, so that I&rsquo;m warned about problems regardless of the circumstances under which I&rsquo;m opening the project.</p>
<p>I was surprised, however, when Sublime complained that it couldn&rsquo;t find a 3rd party library for my <code>import</code> statement. After I validated the project had a <code>venv</code> created and the <code>venv</code> contained the package I was importing, I quickly determined that the problem was related to my tooling rather than the code itself; the code executed fine in my lab environment. In fact, from the <code>venv</code> I could launch the Python REPL and import the library in question without issue. Opening the same project in both Neovim and VSCode didn&rsquo;t result in the same warning. Going directly to the source, I simply ran <code>pylint</code> manually from the CLI. Sure enough, I received the same error:</p>
<p><img src="/2023/pylint_import.png" alt="Sceenshot of pylint reporting that it&amp;rsquo;s unable to import a library"></p>
<p>This next part took me longer than I care to admit to figure out, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure why Sublime and <code>pylint</code> directly couldn&rsquo;t find the packages while Neovim and VSCode could. Neovim typically operates by just looking at what&rsquo;s in the <code>venv</code> from the context where it was launched. VSCode makes me specify which <code>python</code> executable I want to use for the project. Similarly, for pyright to work in Sublime, I need to create a <code>pyrightconfig.json</code> file in the root of the project&rsquo;s directory. This can be done via the command palette, and at its simplest it just tells pyright what the <code>venv</code> is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span style="display:flex;"><span>{
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#f92672">&#34;venvPath&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;.&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#f92672">&#34;venv&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;.venv&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I add this to basically <strong>all</strong> of my Python projects regardless of whether or not I&rsquo;m ever going to open it in Sublime just to make my life easier in the event that I do. If the package was in the <code>.venv</code> directory, why couldn&rsquo;t <code>pylint</code> see it?</p>
<p>The answer that many readers may have guessed already is that at some point I had accidentally installed <code>pylint</code> <strong>globally</strong>. Running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>which pylint
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Showed me that it was installed at: <code>/usr/local/bin/pylint</code></p>
<p>Oops. Given that I had Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 on the same machine, I had to do some quick trial and error to figure out which one had been used to erroneously install <code>pylint</code> so that I could then remove it. Once that was done, I just installed it <em>locally</em> within my project&rsquo;s <code>venv</code> and all was right with the world. Both <code>pylint</code> itself and Sublime were happy to see the library I was attempting to import. As an interesting side note, while Sublime threw a warning about its inability to find the library being imported, the <code>pyrightconfig.json</code> file was still working since autocompletion worked via pyright.</p>
