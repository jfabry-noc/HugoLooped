        <p>It just dawned on me that I&rsquo;ve finally made good progress in decreasing the number of domains that I own. I&rsquo;ve historically purchased domains on a whim; when I&rsquo;m bored or sitting on a bar stool somewhere, I&rsquo;ll grab my phone and check if random domains that pop into my head are available. While the overwhelming majority of them would be taken, I&rsquo;d occasionally strike upon something that hadn&rsquo;t been snatched up. I&rsquo;d typically <em>always</em> buy them&hellip; and then do nothing with them the vast majority of the time. They were basically like <a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a> Pok√©mon.</p>
<p><img src="/2022/icann_domains.png" alt="Ash from Pokemon collecting domain names from ICANN"></p>
<p>A little over a year ago, I decided that I would start to let some of my domains lapse through attrition. I turned off automatic renewal and figured that if I didn&rsquo;t come up with a use for a particular domain by the time I started getting alerts about the fact that it was expiring, then I didn&rsquo;t really need it in the first place. At the time I owned 9 domains. To date, I&rsquo;ve let 5 of them expire. 1 was something I used for a skunk works project at my job that ended up becoming fairly critical to their workflow, so I transferred that domain to the company when I left that job. (Humorously, I never expensed this domain &ndash; even after it became &ldquo;production&rdquo; &ndash; because it renewed on the same date as <a href="https://laifu.moe">laifu.moe</a>, and I didn&rsquo;t want to submit the receipt showing both domains. üòÖ) That leaves me with:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://looped.network">This domain</a>.</li>
<li>The aforementioned <a href="https://laifu.moe">laifu.moe</a>, the domain I&rsquo;ve actually owned the longest, and the only domain I&rsquo;ve ever purchased as a &ldquo;joke&rdquo; and actually done <em>something</em> with.</li>
<li>A random domain I bought prior to deciding that I&rsquo;d rather just use <a href="https://looped.network">looped.network</a> as my primary domain. I&rsquo;m letting this one expire, though it has until next summer.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s typically been easy for me to justify the expense of domains because I tend to use (relatively) inexpensive TLDs. I believe the most expensive domain I&rsquo;ve ever purchased as a <code>.io</code> that was around $40 USD for a year. While TLDs which are $10 to $15 a year are a bit more palatable, they still add up when I&rsquo;ve got a large number of them&hellip; and that cost is doing absolutely nothing if I do nothing with the domain. Today I&rsquo;d only consider purchasing a domain if I have an immediate use for it; I no longer buy any just because it&rsquo;s a fun name that I want to hold on to. I&rsquo;ve actually had a handful of scenarios where I thought of decent domain names and discovered they were available, but so far I&rsquo;ve been walking the straight and narrow without buying them.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a little silly to keep a domain for a single web page, I don&rsquo;t see myself ditching <a href="https://laifu.moe">laifu.moe</a> any time soon since my inner weeb likes it too much. <a href="https://looped.network">looped.network</a> hosts several websites (like this one) and a few servers/services that I run, so it&rsquo;s also pretty locked in. At this point I think I&rsquo;d have to have something pretty outstanding that I wouldn&rsquo;t just host it on another subdomain of <a href="https://looped.network">looped.network</a>.</p>
