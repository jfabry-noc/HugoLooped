    <div><p>I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> off-and-on for around 5 or 6 years at this point. I&rsquo;ve bounced around a handful of servers, and for a (relatively brief) period I even ran my own instance. My frequent comings and goings from Mastodon speak much more to my fleeting interest with social media than with any problems with the platform. While no software is perfect, I think Mastodon does a terrific job of what it sets out to do.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve recently <a href="https://social.sdf.org/@loopednetwork">rejoined the Fediverse</a>, I&rsquo;ve been on the hunt for a Mastodon client for iOS. The majority of my time using Mastodon previously was spent as an Android user, so for most of my time using the platform I was familiar with an entirely different suite of apps. Since swapping to iOS, I&rsquo;ve used a handful of different applications. The primary 2 were <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615">Metatext</a> and an app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone-and-ipad/id1571998974">from the maintainers of the Mastodon platform</a>. I found Metatext to be a solid app that I had no real issues with; I just wanted to see what new things may have arisen during my time away. I found the &ldquo;official&rdquo; app to be quite nice, but I periodically ran into issues with it when it came to refreshing my timelines.</p>
<p>After some quick online searches, I was lucky enough to come across <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884">Ice Cubes</a>. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous app that&rsquo;s also <a href="https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp">open source</a>. I gave it an install and have been using it as the sole Mastodon app on my iPhone for a little over 2 weeks. I have nothing but positive things to say about it at this point.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/icecubes_posts.jpeg" alt="Mastodon posts as viewed from Ice Cubes"></p>
<p>The app itself is packed with functionality; I&rsquo;ve yet to run across something I wanted to do but couldn&rsquo;t because the app didn&rsquo;t have support for it. The performance is also quite snappy, even when it loads up 100 new posts (I believe that&rsquo;s 5 pages via the API) because I haven&rsquo;t opened it for a while. It also seems to support multiple accounts, though I can&rsquo;t speak to how smooth that is since I don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> multiple accounts. The same goes for list management, which I see support for but don&rsquo;t use. That being said, I heavily make use of bookmarks in Mastodon, and Ice Cubes does quite well with them.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/icecubes_profile.jpeg" alt="My Mastodon profile as viewed from Ice Cubes"></p>
<p>Ice Cubes allows for quite a bit of customization throughout the app, including swapping between 5 different themes, changing accent colors, adjusting fonts and line spacing, and even picking between more app icons than I wanted to go through with counting, all of which are honestly gorgeous. For most apps that allow you to pick between a handful of icons, there&rsquo;s typically one or maybe two which are <strong>tolerable</strong>, but with Ice Cubes I frequently swap between a handful of them because I legitimately like them so much. The style is terrific.</p>
<p>Along the the normal post interaction with icons along each for actions like replying, favoriting, boosting, bookmarking, etc., the app allows for customizable actions when swiping left or right on a particular post.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/icecubes_settings.jpeg" alt="Some of the available settings for Ice Cubes"></p>
<p>The app includes in app purchases, though they exist purely to support the developer; no functionality is gated behind them. I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s something well worth the price of admission to chip in to support the app. There are options to subscribe for $1 USD per month or to make one-time donations of $1, $3, $7, or $14 (all USD).</p>
