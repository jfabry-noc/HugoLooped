    <div><h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I recently ran into some issues with the keyboard I had been using for the past few years and decided it was time to opt for something new. The keyboard I was moving away from was the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K2 V2</a>. I&rsquo;ve had a love-hate relationship with mechanical keyboards, flipping between feeling like they give me a really good typing experience and thinking they sacrifice too much in terms of ergonomics to be worth the price of admission. In this particular case I was leaning toward the latter, so I decided to start looking into ergonomic keyobards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used a handful of different ergonomic keyboards over the years. I actually had one in my very first full-time job out of college, though it&rsquo;s been long enough now that I couldn&rsquo;t tell you the brand let alone the model. After that, I didn&rsquo;t use an ergonomic keyboard for quite a few years until the job I was working at managed to have surplus budget and asked everyone to put in requests for peripherals they wanted. I had them buy me a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/8xlw43x19hnt">Microsoft Natural 4000</a> that I ended up using off and on for about 6 years. I was still actively using it as my daily keyboard when I left that job a handful of years ago. As an interesting aside, I want to say that when I got mine, that keyboard sold for roughly $50 USD. It&rsquo;s now selling from random places on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Natural-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Business/dp/B079ZC5V2Y/ref=sr_1_2?crid=JBEOHC8MUP6J&amp;keywords=microsoft%2Bnatural%2B4000&amp;qid=1681676208&amp;sprefix=microsoft%2Bnatural%2B4000%2Caps%2C121&amp;sr=8-2&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.c3015c4a-46bb-44b9-81a4-dc28e6d374b3&amp;th=1">Amazon</a> for $400 USD since it&rsquo;s no longer being made. Yikes!</p>
<p>During the time that I used the Natural 4000 at work, I also procured a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/accessories/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Microsoft Sculpt</a>. It seemed like a pretty nice keyboard, but I only used it for a few days before I accidentally managed to dump an entire beverage into it; my attempts to save it via cleaning couldn&rsquo;t overcome the damage that had been done, so I eventually had to write it off as a lost cause.</p>
<p>When I started a new job a few years back, my boss had asked me what accessories I&rsquo;d like with my new laptop. To compliment the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html">Logitech MX Ergo</a> I requested, I also had them buy a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k350-wave-ergonomic.920-001996.html">Logitech Wave (K350)</a>. While ergonomic, the Wave wasn&rsquo;t a split keyboard. While I don&rsquo;t know if I feel like it gave me the same benefits that I got from a fully split board, it still worked well enough. I used it every day for a few years until the &lsquo;o&rsquo; key stopped working reliably on it. That&rsquo;s when I eventually decided to get back into mechanical keyboards for a bit, going through several of those since no one who uses a mechanical keyboard seems to be able to stick with the same one for very long.</p>
<h2 id="decision">Decision</h2>
<p>I had been starting to move back to the &ldquo;mechanical keyboards are overblown&rdquo; position and wanted to focus on something a bit more ergonomic again. Of course, it&rsquo;s possible to have the best of both worlds with something like the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/">Kinesis Advantage360</a>, but I wasn&rsquo;t looking to spend much north of $100 USD on a keyboard. Spending $300 - $400 on something from Kinesis just feels wild to me. I know several people who own and love their products, but I just can&rsquo;t justify it.</p>
<p>Microsoft continues to produce ergonomic keyboards, such as the Natural 4000&rsquo;s successor, the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/microsoft-ergonomic-keyboard/93841ngdwr1h?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard</a>. They may no longer make it since it isn&rsquo;t listed on their website, but they also at least <em>had</em> been making the more premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Surface-Ergonomic-Kybrd-Bluetooth-English/dp/B0728J9VGB/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3PN59YR04556U&amp;keywords=microsoft+ergonomic+keyboard&amp;qid=1681676941&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=microsoftergonomic+keyboard%2Celectronics%2C127&amp;sr=1-6">Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard</a>. In this particular case, though, I wanted to avoid hardware from Microsoft since I&rsquo;d be mostly using the device with macOS. While there aren&rsquo;t any compatibility issues, Windows-centric keyboards will force me to hit the Windows key when I want to use Command in macOS, and that breaks a lot of muscle memory for me.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to go back to the well with Logitech and buy the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166.html">Logitech Ergo K860</a>. To me it seemed very similar to the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic but with support for both Windows and macOS.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>
<p>The keyboard itself is quite good. It&rsquo;s a simple matte black, which is nice since it doesn&rsquo;t show smudges; I can&rsquo;t fathom why any company would make a glossy keyboard, which is how the Microsoft Sculpt was.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/logi_ergo.jpeg" alt="Logitech Ergonomic K860 keyboard"></p>
<p>Typing on it feels very comfortable, though there was a bit of an adjustment period for me. This was due to 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Switching from several &ldquo;normal&rdquo; keyboards to a split, ergonomic layout.</li>
<li>Switching from mechanical keyboards to  scissor switches.</li>
<li>Switching from TKL keyboards to a full-sized keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Amusingly enough, for me the first point was the least impactful. Having spent quite a bit of time typing on ergonomic keyboards, swapping back to one felt very natural. Moving from mechanical switches to scissor switches was a bit more cumbersome than I expected, especially since for the past year I&rsquo;ve also rarely spent much time typing on a laptop keyboard. The change in experience actually caused me to feel <strong>more</strong> fatigue when typing on the K860 for a couple of days before I became acclimated.</p>
<p>The big difference in swapping from a copule of TKL keyboards to a full-sized keyboard was the positioning of the arrow keys. While I typically use Vim motions for things like my text editors where I write code, it&rsquo;s still common for me to use the arrow keys when editing text in email, Slack, Word, etc. I was surprised at what a difference it made moving my hand a few inches further than I had been accustomed.</p>
<p>After a few days for those adjustments, however, typing on the K860 felt very comfortable and natural. There was never a change in typing speed, only in degrees of muscle fatigue. As can be seen in the image above, it&rsquo;s a little odd that some of the keys (T, G, N) are longer than normal to give the split a uniform edge. Fortunately, the oddity is only in appearance; there&rsquo;s no discernable difference in hitting those keys versus the more uniformly-sized keys across the majority of the keyboard.</p>
<p>The keyboard has no built-in battery, so it requires 2 AAA batteries (which come included.) Having to worry about keeping batteries on-hand is quite annoying, but Logitech claims you can expect around <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/logitech-ergo-k860">2 years of life from them</a>. Given what I&rsquo;ve experienced first-hand from the Logitech M570 trackball and K380 keyboard, I don&rsquo;t doubt those claims. I just need to make sure I actually <strong>have</strong> some spares handy; I&rsquo;m quite guilty of forgetting to charge my MX Ergo trackball and needing to plug it in when it dies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to tell from photos, but the patterned wrist rest is <strong>not</strong> fabric. I&rsquo;m actually amazed that the PCMag review I linked to above for claims about the battery life says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gray cloth upholstery looks nice and is very breathable; my body heat never made it too warm, as tends to happen with leather and leatherette rests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is absolutely not true; it&rsquo;s some kind of plastic/polymer that simply looks like fabric. Calling it &ldquo;cloth&rdquo; is just flat-out wrong. My initial take was that this made it seem like less of a premium device, and that wasn&rsquo;t a great feeling considering the price. However, doing research shows that a fairly common complaint for the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic was that the fabric wrist rest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Got pretty gross over time.</li>
<li>Is impossible to clean.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think a padded wrist rest with a plastic surface patterned to <strong>look</strong> like fabric is kind of the best of both worlds; it looks classy but also offers a surface that won&rsquo;t accumulate anything and is simple to clean if it somehow does.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having used the K860 for about a month now, I&rsquo;m quite happy with it. Various reviews online will complain that it doesn&rsquo;t feature backlighting, but I honestly couldn&rsquo;t care less about that. I wanted a keyboard that would give me a solid and comfortable typing experience, and that&rsquo;s exactly what the K860 offers. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that, especially coming from a couple of TKL keyboards, it&rsquo;s a <em>massive</em> device that will take up a lot of desk space. My <a href="https://looped.network/posts/home-office-upgrade/">new desk setup</a> allows for that, but only because I use a trackball. If I wanted to place a mouse next to this keyboard, I feel like it would be fairly awkward to move around. It&rsquo;s probably also worth mentioning that I&rsquo;m well past my gaming days, so I&rsquo;m not attempting to use it for any PC games. I&rsquo;d have to imagine that trying to play a game like <em>StarCraft</em> or <em>World of Warcraft</em> that involves using the entire keyboard with a single hand could be cumbersome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not for everyone, but if you&rsquo;re a fan of mechanical keyboards who doesn&rsquo;t care whether or not your keyboard is mechanical, then this is definitely worth some consideration. And if you&rsquo;re an ergonomic keyboard user who demands a mechanical keyboard, then I just feel bad for your bank account.</p>
