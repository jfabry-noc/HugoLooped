        <p>In a move that was <em>highly</em> overdue, I finally redid my home office several weeks ago. It&rsquo;s actually embarrassing to share, but this is what it had looked like prior to the overhaul&hellip; not that I would even call this an office:</p>
<p><img src="/2023/old_tiny_desk.jpeg" alt="Tiny, cramped desk with one monitor, 75% keyboard, and a laptop stand"></p>
<h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Saying that the desk is small is an understatement. I&rsquo;ve actually owned this desk for <strong>years</strong>, and the story behind it is that I needed a small desk at my previous apartment. This was back when I was still gaming regularly (read: spending every waking moment of my life playing <em>World of Warcraft</em> if I wasn&rsquo;t working.) Rather than clutter up my living room with gaming stuff, I had a decent-sized desk in my bedroom where my gaming setup lived. I started working from home 3 days a week for the job I had at the time, though, so I decided to get a second desk that I would use for that instead of trying to do both at my gaming desk, which really didn&rsquo;t have the room for it considering my gaming desktop was sitting on top of it. As a result, I opted to buy this fairly small desk so that it would still fit in my bedroom alongside all the other furniture without making things feel too cramped.</p>
<p>Fast forward several years, and I was in the middle of moving for a new job. At this point I had mostly stopped playing games, and I ended up throwing out my gaming desk since it was around 12 years old. It was fairly beat up, it had several dings along the surface that I needed to keep covered with a desk mat, and it was starting to sag in the middle. Since the job I was taking didn&rsquo;t have any remote work (at the time), I decided I was okay with just moving the small desk since I&rsquo;d only be using it occasionally with my personal laptop.</p>
<p>Fast forward a little more and the COVID19 pandemic changed everything. I started working from home full time. While using such a small desk every day felt a little silly, early on I was under the impression that we&rsquo;d be going back to the office after a few weeks. It was also spring, so I tried to spend time working outside on my deck since I wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere else at the time. Suffice to say, working remotely for just a few months isn&rsquo;t what happened, and I became a fully remote employee. However, I just felt used to the desk and honestly didn&rsquo;t give it much additional thought. This continued for several years until I eventually left that job for my current role, which is also 100% remote. At this point I realized that if I was going to keep living in my current apartment, I really needed to upgrade my setup. After some research convinced me that staying in my current home was the best decision, I knew it was time for my long-overdue upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="the-upgrade">The Upgrade<a href="#the-upgrade" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I spent some time chatting with a good friend of mine who happens to be something of a guru when it comes to all things home computing, and she helped me narrow down some of the different options that would be a good fit. I have a <strong>lot</strong> of space, as you can probably tell from the first photo, because my &ldquo;home office&rdquo; is actually what is intended to be my dining room. However, I have a bar-top in my apartment with several stools at it, and since I live by myself I literally always eat my meals there; I actually got rid of the table and chairs I used at my last apartment when I moved since I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t use them here.</p>
<p>My main idea was that I wanted to have 2 distinct setups: one for work and one for personal. It wasn&rsquo;t so much for a mental break between the two but just to keep me from having to constantly be swapping peripherals between my laptops. My initial thought was to get a very long desk and have two distinct spaces right next to one another. After looking at a few options in person, though, I decided I liked the idea of two medium-length desks that I could put together in an L shape. That&rsquo;s what I eventually ended up deciding to go with:</p>
<p><img src="/2023/new_desk_setup_main.jpeg" alt="2 desks in an L configuration with 2 distinct computer setups"></p>
<p>On the way back from buying the desks, we also stopped at a computer hardware store where I bought the second (larger) monitor to include with the new setup. This allows me to just operate off of the 2 external displays while I&rsquo;m working, leaving the laptop itself closed. To the right is my current personal setup, which is just a laptop on a stand that brings it close enough for me to use given how terrible my vision is. I <em>may</em> eventually get a monitor for this setup as well, but I&rsquo;m also debating getting either a new laptop or swapping to a mini-PC of some sort. Until I make a firm decision on that, I&rsquo;m happy enough with a laptop stand and 2 wireless peripherals I never need to worry about plugging and unplugging.</p>
<p>I also ended up changing the rest of the space a bit, taking a large chair that I had for years and tucking it into a corner after shifting around a small set of bookshelves and a replacement for the coffee table in the first photo that I swapped with a different one in my apartment to keep the all-black-everything theme going:</p>
<p><img src="/2023/new_desk_setup_lounge.jpeg" alt="Different angle of the same office from the last photo showing the edge of the desk and a bucket chair"></p>
<p>This makes for a cozy little &ldquo;lounge&rdquo; part of my office. I usually sit there in the morning with a cup of coffee and read before I start work for the day. I&rsquo;ll also hop into the chair to <del>doom</del>scroll through my phone when I&rsquo;m taking a break or if I&rsquo;m on a call that doesn&rsquo;t require me to be in front of my computer. In fact, if I&rsquo;m not actively working on my computer as a part of the call, I actually like stepping away from it to ensure that I focus on the call instead of getting distracted by some code I was in the middle of working on, a Slack message, etc.</p>
<p>While I feel a little ridiculous for working under such cramped conditions for so long, it really was something I just got acclimated to and didn&rsquo;t feel particularly inconvenienced by at the time. Now that I&rsquo;ve upgraded, though, this is easily my favorite part of the apartment, and I find myself spending a lot of time here even when I&rsquo;m not working. It&rsquo;s amazing how much easier it is to focus on things like my personal side projects or maintaining this blog when I have a comfortable space to do so.</p>
