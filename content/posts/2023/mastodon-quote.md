Last week, the [following post dropped on the Mastodon blog](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/). This post caused quite a stir within some of the Fediverse. For most folks, the issue seemed to be with a new design decision on the mobile apps to offer a quick setup experience for [Mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social).

> Today we’re making signing up on Mastodon easier than ever before. We understand that deciding which Mastodon service provider to kick off your experience with can be confusing. We know this is a completely new concept for many people, since traditionally the platform and the service provider are one and the same. This choice is what makes Mastodon different from existing social networks, but it also presents a unique onboarding challenge. To make this step easier, we now have a default sign-up option that works with a server we operate. If you wish to leave or join a different server, you can do so at any time.

Some people felt _very_ strongly that this went against the ideals of federation by making the path of least resistence a server which is already the most popular one out there. While this argument may be sound in a vacuum, I think in the big picture it honestly doesn't matter. If you've ever attempted to get folks to join Mastodon, even technical people, the onboarding process is tricky. Trying to pick a server is something most users aren't familiar with when it comes to social media. As a result, just getting an account created is often one of the biggest hurdles. If users aren't already eyeing up a particular instance where their friends are, if they make it through the process of creating a brand new account then chances are that they'll end up picking [Mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) anyway just because it's the biggest and most prominent. By making that a default from the mobile apps, it's just decreasing the barrier to entry for people who were most likely to pick that instance regardless.

## Quotes

On the other hand, this was what gave me consternation from the post, emphasis mine:

> We’re always listening to the community and we’re excited to bring you some of the most requested features, such as **quote posts**, improved content and profile search, and groups.

I was really disappointed to see quote posts as an area of development. Those who have been around Mastodon for a while likely know that this has been a topic of discussion time and again. For the longest time, the core developers have rejected implementing it, rightly (in my opinion) stating that it's a feature that enables toxicity far too easily. It's super simple to spend no time at all thinking about what you just read; instead you click one bottom and put someone on blast with a hot take. It's bad for everyone. Unfortunately, it seems that the number of Twitter refugees complaining about it finally reached a critical mass where it was decided the fallout from not having it is worse than the toxicity that will result from adding it. That's extremely unfortunate to me, and I don't look forward to seeing the results.

I've already noticed that the Fediverse seems to have a lot more drama than it previously did when I used it prior to the latest few mass-exoduses of Twitter users. While I had initially followed a handful of people I previously followed years ago on Twitter when I was still using it, I quickly unfollowed the majority of them that honestly seemed more interested in creating drama and complaining about a "lack" of features in Mastodon than just sharing their thoughts and creating interesting content. If nothing else, unfollowing those users and liberally adding phrases I'm muting to my filters have kept the experience decent. I'm also fortunate to be a part of a [small and interesting Mastodon server](https://social.sdf.org) that allows me to actually use the local timeline (something that's increasingly difficult to even view in the "official" Mastodon app.)

None of this is meant to cast any aspirsions to the core developers of Mastodon. They're the ones who need to make decisions on what's best for the platform, and they obviously have a much better understanding of things than I do. I just hope the tools to keep the experience positive continue to grow alongside the implementation of controversial new features; I'd love the ability to filter out quote posts when it's added, for example.
