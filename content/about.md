I'm a software developer (Python, C#, Groovy) with a background in DevOps (Puppet, K8s, Terraform), networking (FortiNet, Cradlepoint), and systems administration (Active Directory, DNS, DHCP.) I used to blog very regularly for years before giving it up for a while, so we'll see how long it lasts this time. In the meantime, you can also find me at:
